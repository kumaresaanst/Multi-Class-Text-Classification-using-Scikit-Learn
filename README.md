# Multi-Class-Text-Classification-using-Scikit-Learn

Here the dataset contains Text reviews as a feature and its ratings as output

The job is to train the reviews and ratings to learn the function behind it so that in future if any new review is published, we can be able to predict the ratings of the review

Still going deep, I have figured out the weight of each of the unique words in the dataset and its probability to be which rating review

For example: If the particular word is "Bad", The probability of that word in 1 star rating is more than that of 5 star rating

As a result of it, we can be able to find out of the probability of particular word in 1 star, 2 star, 3 star etc
